**Introduction**
- Context of Modelling Approach
  - Agent-Based Model (ABM) are used to represent individual travelers as autonomous agents
  - Unlike activity-based models that focus on daily shedules, ABM emphasizes interactions and emergent behavior at the system level
  - MATSim is ABM framework widely used for transport simulation and policy analysis 
- Current Learning Focus
  - Understanding how MATSim agents perform replanning through iterations to reach a behavioral equilibrium
  - Exploring how GTFS data (routes, stops, timetables) can be converted and used to build realistic MATSim network
  - Examining technical mechanism such as multi-threading and scenario iteration to improve computational efficiency
- Research Direction
  - Integrating GTFS-based public transport data with a private shuttle service (e.g., Micron Shuttle) inside MATSim simulation.
  - Comparing system performance across different integration scenarios.
  - Developing a methodological framework for evaluating the integration of public and private transport services using agent-based simulation
  - Quantifying accessibility and equity outcomes to identify which integration strategy provides the most balanced benefits
