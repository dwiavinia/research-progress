- **Previous Discussion (Key points)**
   - Integration requires not only technical modeling but also **new institutional frameworks**.
   - Should consider how different actors (company, university, city) **coordinate and share responsibilities**.
   - The concept of value capture shows how transport investment can raise nearby land or business value, and part of that gain can be reinvested to support the transport system. The main idea is that public transport alone is rarely profitable, but becomes more sustainable when connected to wider economic value or shared funding mechanisms.
   - Several local examples show how shared funding could support more sustainable transport services. The Micron Shuttle is currently private but could benefit from coordination with public buses. Kurose University once operated its own bus service but found it costly, leading to discussions on cost-sharing with the city. Another example is Yume Town, a commercial center that benefits from bus routes and improved accessibility; such businesses could potentially contribute to transport development as part of a shared-benefit arrangement. These cases illustrate small-scale collaborations where public and private actors share responsibilities to maintain better mobility services.
   - Idea of “New Style PPP”**
     - Not a large-scale PPP project, but localized collaboration between city, business, and institution.
     - Focused on service-level improvement and cost-sharing 
   - Simulation–Policy Link: MATSim simulation should connect to **who benefits** and **how cost could be shared**.


**LITERATURE REVIEW**
Francesca Medda (2012) — *Land Value Capture Finance for Transport Accessibility*
- *Journal of Transport Geography*, Vol. 25, pp. 154–161.  
- **Focus:** Accessibility-based financing mechanisms for urban transport investments.

**Overview**
This paper explores how cities can finance transport infrastructure by capturing part of the land value created through improved accessibility, a principle known as Land Value Capture (LVC).

**Three main mechanisms:**
1. Betterment Tax
   - Levy on property owners benefiting from accessibility gain.
   - Insight: Works in strong fiscal systems; may raise equity concerns 
2. Accessibility Increment Contribution (AIC) 
   - Earmarks future tax revenue from improved accessibility to fund current investments.
   - Insight: Fits cities with clear accessibility growth potential 
3. Joint Development
   - Public–private cooperation for shared construction and profit.
   - Insight: Ideal for suburban, non-fiscal contexts 

**Key Concepts**
- Accessibility Value:  
  > “The extent to which land-use and transport systems enable individuals to reach activities or destinations.”  
- Two Components of Land Value:  
  - *(A)* Accessibility-based (from public investment)  
  - *(B)* Improvement/construction-based (from private action)

**Major Insights**
1. Accessibility as Value Creation
   - Transport investments increase accessibility → generate urban value via time savings, market access, and connectivity.
   - However, effects can be uneven - some gain, some lose - so value capture must target actual beneficiaries, not assume uniform benefit.
2. Context Sensitivity  
   >  “It is disingenuous to use a standardized model of land value capture finance replicated across cities.”
   - Each city’s economic, legal, and spatial context demands its own model.
   - Question : For suburban Japan, which approach is more feasible and realistic — fiscal taxation or non-fiscal, partnership-based LVC?
3. Beyond Land Taxation  
   -  User charges and property taxes are often regressive or insufficient.
   - New forms — such as corporate, employer, or retail contributions — can distribute value more fairly among beneficiaries.
4. LVC as Collaborative Framework  
   > “The main potential benefit of LVC is its flexibility in adapting incentives and risk-sharing to project characteristics."
   - Insight: Effective LVC depends on flexibility, stakeholder cooperation, and context alignment.

**Stepwise Framework** 
| Step | Description  | Notes for This Research |
|------|--------------|-------------------------|
| **1. Set Accessibility Targets** | Define measurable indicators (travel time, coverage, ridership) to guide investment goals. | ΔAccessibility in MATSim represents this step. |
| **2. Review Fiscal & Planning Frameworks** | Assess if local fiscal systems support LVC; if not, opt for non-fiscal models (joint development). | The message is that not all mechanisms are suitable for every city. Each city must adapt based on: its socio-economic conditions, its fiscal capacity, and the form of accessibility it aims to achieve. |
| **3. Select LVC Mechanisms** | Choose or combine mechanisms suitable for the project; ensure revenue–expenditure transparency. | transparency and a clear link between contribution and benefit are the keys to building trust. |
| **4. Stakeholder Engagement** | Build cooperative, multi-sector participation (govt, developers, business, residents). | Similar to Istanbul’s Akaretler case; collaborative local model. |
| **5. Monitoring & Evaluation** | Measure **social return on investment** (ridership, poverty reduction, job creation). | MATSim outputs = accessibility-based monitoring tools. |

**Overarching Concepts:**  
- *Context* → every city is unique.  
- *Accessibility Value* → foundation linking transport investment and sustainable finance.

**Comparative View of LVC Mechanisms**

| Mechanism             | Type                    | Strength                                        | Weakness                                               |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Betterment Tax**    | Fiscal                  | High revenue; simple logic                      | Requires strong tax admin; potential equity issues |
| **AIC / TIF**         | Fiscal–Incentive Hybrid | Connects accessibility gain with future revenue | Risk of opaque finance; speculative outcomes           |
| **Joint Development** | Non-Fiscal              | Flexible, cooperative, equitable                | Needs capable stakeholders and coordination  |

**Research Gap**
1. There is a lack of empirical and simulation-based approaches to evaluate LVC efficiency using accessibility metrics.
2. Most existing LVC research focuses on property value appreciation, whereas accessibility-based value creation remains underexplored, especially in suburban or non-rail contexts.
3. There is limited understanding of how accessibility improvements (e.g., travel time, coverage, ridership changes) can be converted into measurable value for equitable, non-fiscal partnership schemes.

**Relevance to My Research**
| Concept from Medda | Interpretation in My Study |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Accessibility = core of value creation** | Quantified using MATSim (ΔAccessibility) |
| **LVC must fit local context** | Local non-fiscal partnership |
| **Flexibility & cooperation are key** | Build Accessibility-Linked Business Contribution (ALBC) model |
| **Evaluate beyond revenue** | Accessibility-based indicators show social and economic value |

**Key Quote**
> “It is therefore important to develop research for evaluating the most efficient and sustainable LVC to finance transport investments based on accessibility.” — *Medda (2012)*

- Insight: This paper serves both as **theoretical foundation** and **research direction**, urging a shift from **land-price-based** to **accessibility-based** value capture and cooperative finance.

**Points to Clarify**
- Question: For the direction of my research scope, should the value capture concept stay as a policy implication from the MATSim results, or should I develop it further as an analytical framework connected to accessibility gain?
- Regarding joint development, could the integration between the private Shuttle and the public transit system represent a form of micro joint development that minimizes fiscal burdens while improving system efficiency and producing collective social benefits?
- Regarding this statement in Medda (2012):
  > “These modest results may be due on the one hand, to the transport operators’ limited experience of land value estimation and on the other, to their unwillingness to engage in real estate and other business pursuits apart from the operation of the transport system” (Medda, 2012, p. 159)
- Alternatively, should local governments and transport operators be equipped with a stronger business-oriented mindset to ensure financial sustainability?
