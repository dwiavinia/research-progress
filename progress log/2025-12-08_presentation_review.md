Previous Discussion:
- Service Frequency and Travel Time (Private vs Public)
  - The private Micron shuttle operates at high frequency, with peak headways of approximately 10–17 minutes, especially during morning and evening work periods.
  - Total observed services amount to 56 trips per day (both directions combined), which corresponds to 28 trips per direction, concentrated around commuting hours.
  - The average travel time for the Micron shuttle is approximately 50 minutes, with a tight and regular schedule, particularly in peak periods.
  - Stops are highly concentrated near Saijo Station and Micron, with very few intermediate stops, reflecting an efficiency-oriented, employee-focused service design.
- Spatial Characteristics of Stops
  - Most shuttle stops are located around Saijo Station, functioning as a collection point rather than a corridor service.
  - There are limited stops along the route, reinforcing the shuttle’s role as a direct commuter service, not a neighborhood-serving public bus.
  - This contrasts with typical public bus routes, which prioritize broader spatial coverage rather than speed.
- Comparison with Public Bus Services
  - Public bus services from Saijo Station to Micron exist but are extremely limited, with only around five trips per day.
  - These services are spread across four long routes (e.g., Hachihonmatsu–Micron and return), resulting in low effective frequency.
  - Due to this low frequency and long travel times, Micron employees cannot realistically rely on public buses for daily commuting.
- Temporal Coverage and Work Pattern Mismatch
  - Micron factory workers follow a non-standard work cycle (e.g., 2 days work, 1 day rest), which does not align with weekday/weekend public transport schedules.
  - Public buses provide some early-morning and evening services, but do not sufficiently cover late-night or irregular shifts.
  - Micron shuttles extend later into the evening (up to around 22:00), but still do not operate at true midnight hours.
- Issues Identified in GTFS Public Data
  - Key routes, particularly Saijo Station–Hirodai, which are known to be major and frequent services, are missing or not properly represented in the GTFS dataset.
  - Route overlaps and inconsistencies in route IDs and service definitions suggest data structure problems, not actual service absence.
  - These issues are present in the original GTFS (before MATSim conversion), indicating the need for careful GTFS validation and cleaning.
- Interpretation of Hirodai vs Micron Connectivity
  - Routes connected to Hirodai show much higher availability and flexibility compared to those serving Micron.
  - There is no direct or strong linkage between Hirodai routes and Micron-bound services, highlighting spatial and functional segregation in the network.
  - This reinforces Micron’s dependence on its private shuttle system.
- Conceptual Implications for Integration
  - The Micron shuttle is operationally efficient but systemically inefficient, as buses often return empty and occupy road space without serving the public.
  - Integrating private shuttles into public service could:
    - Reduce redundancy
    - Improve overall frequency without adding new vehicles,
    - Increase accessibility for non-employee residents.
  - However, integration would likely reduce service exclusivity for Micron employees, potentially increasing travel time and reducing seating availability.
- Cost, PPP Logic, and Simulation Direction
  - Micron currently operates approximately 55 shuttle services per day, implying a daily operational cost close to 1 million JPY.
  - The discussion frames this as a non-land-based PPP problem, focused on operational cost sharing, not taxation or land value capture.
- Simulation (MATSim) is proposed to:
  - Distinguish Micron workers vs local residents as users
  - Quantify accessibility gains
  - Estimate a fair cost-sharing ratio between public authorities and private companies.
- A key principle is:
  - If most users are Micron employees → Micron should bear most costs.
  - If a significant share are local residents → public contribution is justified.
- Research Direction Clarified
  - The study should move beyond a Micron-only case toward a general framework for private shuttle integration.
  - Potential scenarios include:
    - Simple conversion of private shuttles into public services
    - Full integration and optimization of public and private routes
    - Evaluation of efficiency gains versus service performance loss.
  - The contribution lies in demonstrating that accessibility-based, operational PPP schemes can be evaluated quantitatively using simulation.
