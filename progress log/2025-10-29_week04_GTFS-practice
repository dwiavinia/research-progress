**Research Goal**
To evaluate how integrating private shuttle services with the public transport system affects both network efficiency and traveler behavior, and to assess its policy feasibility as a sustainable strategy for improving urban mobility and service accessibility.

**Sub-Goals**
- Data & Network Preparation
  To combine GTFS feeds of public bus and private shuttle into a unified, MATSim-compatible network representing the current   and integrated systems.
- Behavioral Analysis
  To analyze how travelers (agents) adapt their route and mode choices when shuttle access, fares, and capacity are modified under policy-driven integration scenarios.
- Efficiency Evaluation
  To measure changes in total system travel time, congestion, and vehicle utilization after the integration of shuttle and bus services.
- Policy Assessment
  To interpret simulation results as policy evidence—evaluating whether shuttle–bus integration can serve as an effective, balanced solution for first–last mile connectivity and spatial accessibility.

**Research Question**
- How do travelers adapt their route and mode choices when shuttle access and fares change?
- To what extent does integration reduce travel time and congestion?
- Can shuttle–bus integration be considered a feasible and balanced transport policy?

**Data**
- Public Transport Network
  GTFS feed of public bus routes, stops, trips, and schedules.
  Source: Local transport agency (GTFS)
- Private Shuttle Network
  Shuttle routes, stops, and schedule converted to GTFS format.
  Source: Micron company data / field survey
- Road Network
  Street network, intersections, and coordinates.
  Source: OpenStreetMap (OSM shapefile)
- Population & Demand Data
  Synthetic population, OD data, or demographic distribution.
  Source: Census data / generated model
- Policy & Operation Parameters
  Fare, capacity, headway, transfer stops, and access rules. (To be determined)
  Source: Derived from official or assumed parameters
- Spatial Reference Data 
  Administrative boundaries.
  Source: GIS 

**Methodology**
1. Data Pre-processing
   Clean and merge GTFS feeds from public transport and private shuttle.
   Align schedules and define transfer stops.
   Convert the merged dataset into MATSim-compatible XML files (network.xml, transitSchedule.xml, vehicles.xml).
   Tools: Python (gtfs-kit, partridge), pt2matsim
2. Scenario Development
   Define four policy scenarios:
   - Baseline (no integration)
   - Open Integration (public access)
   - Regulated Integration (controlled access)
   - Coordinated Network (long-term policy)
   Tools: MATSim configuration folders
3. Simulation in MATSim
   Run agent-based simulations for each scenario.
   Allow agents to iteratively replan routes and modes until behavioral equilibrium is reached.
   Modules: MATSim core modules (network, transit, population)
4. Indicator Extraction and Analysis
   Extract outputs to evaluate three dimensions:
   Efficiency: travel time, congestion, load factor.
   Behavior: mode share, number of replanning agents.
   Policy Impact: service coverage.
   Tools: MATSim Events and Accessibility modules, Python or R for post-processing
5. Policy Interpretation
   Compare results across scenarios to assess how integration policies influence efficiency and user behavior.
   Derive policy implications for local transport planning.
   
**Scenario Design**
Scenario 0 – Baseline
Current system where the Micron Shuttle serves only Micron employees, with no integration with the bus network.
Policy Setting: No policy integration.
Purpose: To represent current inefficiencies and access limitations.

Scenario 1A – Open Integration
Shuttle becomes part of the public transport system; public access allowed with a unified fare structure.
Policy Setting: Full policy access.
Purpose: To test maximum efficiency gain and behavioral change potential.

Scenario 1B – Regulated Integration
Shuttle integrated but with fare or capacity limits; coordinated schedule with existing buses.
Policy Setting: Controlled policy.
Purpose: To balance efficiency and fairness, and prevent bus ridership loss.

Scenario 2 – Coordinated Network (Vision)
Long-term policy vision where shuttle and buses operate under a unified institutional framework with integrated GTFS data and schedules.
Policy Setting: Strategic governance.
Purpose: To evaluate long-term sustainability and governance model for urban mobility improvement.
