**LITERATURE REVIEW**
>Murakami, Jin, and K. I. Gregory. "Transit value capture: New town codevelopment models and land market updates in Tokyo and Hong Kong." Value capture and land policies (2012): 285-320.

**Background**
- Global cities increasingly invest in mega transit systems, but most face severe cost overruns and operating deficits, with more than 90% of systems depending on public subsidies; only Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Singapore achieve positive operating balances due to strong value capture integration.
- The core mechanism behind value capture is accessibility improvement: rail transit reduces travel cost and time, enlarges opportunity spaces, and increases land value, especially where land markets are active and development institutions are coordinated.

**Practices of Value Capture in Hongkong and Tokyo**
- After decades of rapid rail-led urban expansion, both Tokyo and Hong Kong entered a new phase where population aging, slow-growth economies, and lower demand for large-scale suburban development forced transit operators to update their business models.
- The chapter highlights that in the 21st century, successful value capture is no longer dependent only on land-value uplift; it now depends on continuous property management, diversified business platforms, and resilient institutional coordination between transit agencies and land authorities.

**New Town Co-development Models (Tokyo & Hong Kong)**
- Compares five major rail-based co-development models 
  1. Tokyu Denentoshi Line (Garden City Model, Tokyo)
  2. Hokuso Line (Airport Access Model, Tokyo)
  3. Tsukuba Express Line (Science City Model, Tokyo)
  4. Airport Express / Tung Chung Line (Airport Access Model, Hong Kong)
  5. West Rail Line (Linear City Model, Hong Kong)
- Hong Kong Co-Development Models: Key Events & Insights
  ----------------------------
| What Happened in Hong Kong (2001–2006) | Insight for Research |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Growth of knowledge-based clusters in CBD and Kowloon due to strong rail accessibility. | Transport integration will strengthen existing nodes, rather than create brand-new ones. |
| Decline of old industries as service sectors expanded along rail corridors. | Expect changes in activity mix, not land-value-based gentrification—more services, student/labor mobility. |
| Airport Express/Tung Chung (AE/TC) had weak suburbanization effects. | Integration may not shift jobs outward; impacts will cluster in high-demand anchors only. |
| West Rail (WR) created economic specialization between Kowloon and New Territories. | Integration will clarify spatial roles. |
| Rail corridors caused industrial redistribution, not purely growth. | Shuttle–bus integration may create redistributive effects (shifting activity patterns). |

- Comparative Table: New Town Co-Development Models (Tokyo & Hong Kong)
------------------------------------
| Corridor | Model Type | Anchor Type | Governance | Land Development | Market Outcome | VC Strength |
|---------|------------|-------------|------------|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Tokyu Denentoshi (Tokyo)** | Garden City | Multi-purpose (housing + retail + commuters) | Private entrepreneurial company | Strong land readjustment + integrated TOD | Stable suburban communities; strong ridership; diverse activities | **Strong** (land + nonfare) |
| **Hokuso Line (Tokyo)** | Airport Access | Single-purpose (Airport) | Multiple public entities; fragmented | Underdeveloped; weak suburban housing | Low ridership; high fares; limited mixed use | **Weak** |
| **Tsukuba Express (Tokyo)** | Science City (PPP) | University + research cluster | PPP with coordinated public entities | Large-scale land readjustment; planned suburban growth | Moderate suburbanization; rising service jobs | **Moderate** |
| **Airport Express / Tung Chung (HK)** | Airport Access | Single-purpose (Airport) | MTR Corporation | New town but weak multipurpose demand | Weak suburbanization; minimal uplift | **Weak** |
| **West Rail (HK)** | Linear City | Mixed anchors (urban–suburban corridor) | KCR Corporation | Station-area development planned along corridor | Strong Kowloon service cluster; spatial division with NT | **Moderate–Strong** |
----------------------------------------

**Market Location Shifts (Jobs & Worker Profiles)**
- Across both Tokyo and Hong Kong, the findings show that transit investment mainly causes **redistributive** effects—shifting jobs and residents within the metropolitan region—rather than creating entirely new regional growth.
- Transit corridors reshape the internal geography of labor markets—sometimes strengthening CBD dominance, sometimes supporting suburban nodes—but their impact is highly dependent on anchor type, governance coordination, and the maturity of surrounding land markets
- Key Mechanisms Driving Job/Worker Redistribution
------------------------------------
| Mechanism | Effect on Jobs | Effect on Workers | Seen In | VC Relevance |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|---------|--------------|
| Strong multi-function anchor | Attracts service & knowledge jobs | Encourages residential in-migration | Tokyu, West Rail | Enhances clustering & VC |
| Single-function anchor (airport) | Concentrates narrow job types | Weak residential relocation | Hokuso, AE/TC | Produces weak VC |
| Land readjustment completion | Triggers suburban service growth | Stabilizes new-town housing | Tsukuba Express | Improves long-term VC potential |
| Mature land market | Speeds redistribution & value response | Attracts workers to high-access areas | Tokyu | Supports land-based VC |
| Institutional coordination (PPP) | Harmonizes transit + land | Predictable suburban development | Tsukuba Express | Strengthens accessibility-based VC |

  - mixed-use density       - service availability
  - governance               - travel-time savings

          RESULTING PATTERNS
          -------------------
          • Urban–suburban redistribution  
          • CBD strengthening (Tokyu, West Rail)  
          • Weak suburbanization (Airport-based models)  
          • Moderate suburban growth (Tsukuba Express)

**Land Values Changes**
- The results demonstrate that land-value uplift does not automatically occur with new transit; uplift depends on land market maturity, anchor diversity, and institutional coordination—not merely the presence of rail infrastructure

**Conclusion & Policy Implications**
- Transit value capture is highly dependent on broader urban conditions: it works best where cities have strong development pressures, coordinated land governance, and active property markets—conditions found in Tokyo and Hong Kong during their major expansion periods.
- The timing of rail investment matters: private-led co-development models (like Tokyu and early MTR) performed well during high-growth eras, but as population growth slows and land becomes scarce, governments take on larger financial burdens and must rely on more diverse revenue sources.
- Long-term financial sustainability now depends less on selling new land parcels and more on continuous property stewardship, including shopping malls, retail centers, station commerce, and mixed-use redevelopment around transit hubs.
- **Successful value capture requires not only transit infrastructure but also strategic land-use integration, strong anchors (e.g., universities, mixed-use centers, CBD extensions), and stable institutions capable of coordinating transit, housing, and commercial development.**
- **The experiences of Tokyo and Hong Kong show that value capture in the 21st century is no longer solely land-based; instead, it depends on accessibility-induced benefits, nonfare commercial revenue, and continuous asset management tied to transit operations.**
- **Policymakers should therefore adopt holistic frameworks linking mobility, land use, urban regeneration, governance coordination, and long-term financial planning rather than relying on narrow, property-sale-based funding mechanisms.**

**Key Insights from Tokyo & Hong Kong for Research**
---------------------------------------
| Original Finding | Meaning in the Cases | Implication for Higashi-Hiroshima |
|------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| VC succeeds when anchors are multi-functional | Tokyu success = housing + retail + commuters | Micron alone is insufficient; but corridor has multi-anchors: University, Station, Commerce |
| Airport-based corridors show weak suburbanization | Hokuso and AE/TC both weak due to single-purpose anchors | Avoid treating Micron like an "airport"; promote multi-purpose daily trips |
| PPP improves outcomes when coordinated | Tsukuba Express improved after land readjustment + PPP | H-Hiroshima needs strong city–university–Micron coordination |
| Land uplift requires mature housing markets | Hokuso & TX showed weak effects until 2010 | Land-based VC will NOT work; shift to accessibility-based VC |
| Transit redistributes activity more than creates new growth | Seen in all five corridors | Expect redistribution (activity shifting) rather than land-value changes |
| Strong nonfare revenue stabilizes transit | Tokyu & MTR rely on retail + malls + services | Operational VC possible: station commerce, improved ridership in Saijo |
