1. Equity financing
   - Equity funds are invested as share capital or shareholder funds in the project company.
   - Equity has the lowest priority in the payment hierarchy.
   - Equity investors are paid only after all debts are serviced and only if the project is profitable.
   - In the event of termination or insolvency, equity investors are repaid last and may lose their entire investment.
   - Equity therefore bears the highest risk but offers unlimited upside potential.
2. Debt financing
   - Debt contributions have the highest priority among invested funds.
   - Senior debt must be serviced before any subordinated debt or equity.
   - Debt repayment follows a fixed or floating interest rate with a predetermined payment schedule.
   - Lenders receive no upside from project profitability beyond the agreed interest and principal.
   - Debt is lower risk than equity but provides limited and predictable returns.
3. Senior debt
   - Senior debt is the safest form of project financing.
   - It has first claim on project cash flows and assets.
   - Common providers include banks, development banks, bondholders, and pension funds.
   - Lower risk is reflected in lower interest rates compared to other financing layers.
4. Mezzanine / subordinated financing
   - Mezzanine financing sits between senior debt and equity in priority.
   - It includes instruments such as subordinated loans and preference shares.
   - Mezzanine investors are repaid after senior debt but before equity.
   - Because of higher risk, mezzanine contributors are compensated through:
     - higher interest rates than senior debt, and/or
     - participation in project profits or capital gains.
   - Mezzanine financing helps close funding gaps and improve project bankability.
5. Publicly listed companies and project financing
   - Buying shares in a publicly listed company makes an investor an equity holder, not a lender.
   - Secondary market share trading does not directly finance projects.
   - Projects are typically funded through:
     - internal cash flows,
     - debt financing, and
     - occasionally new equity issuance (e.g., rights issues).
   - In PPPs, projects are often financed through special purpose vehicles (SPVs) rather than corporate balance sheets.
6. Government financing
   - Government financing is the most common approach for public infrastructure.
   - It includes:
     - on-lending of borrowed funds,
     - grants or subsidies,
     - guarantees of project debt.
7. Governments can usually borrow at lower interest rates due to strong creditworthiness.
   - However, government financing is constrained by:
     - limited fiscal space,
     - debt capacity limits,
     - competition among multiple public priorities.
   - Governments are generally less efficient at managing commercial risks.
8. Rationale for PPP in transport
   - PPPs are used to:
     - reduce pressure on public budgets,
     - transfer commercial and operational risks to private partners,
     - leverage private-sector efficiency.
   - Governments often prefer debt-based support or service payments rather than equity participation.
   - Equity participation by government is limited and typically occurs only in strategic or high-risk projects, often via state-owned or sovereign investment vehicles.
